# This project dives in Convolutional Neural Networks and tries to find out how convolutional layers work using Pytorch.

# How to use:
CNN_neo.py stores the neural network model and the training code. To see the calculation result in each step, set breakpoint in related nerual network line with debug mode. 

The code is also available to store gradients for back-proporgation. 

training_data.npy stores converted data from kaggle cat-and-dog dataset.

load_data.py stores the data-preprocessing code that convert raw image data to numpy forms.
